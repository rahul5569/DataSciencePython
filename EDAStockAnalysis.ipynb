Stock's pct change fluctuated four times over the period.\n2. The period between May 2021 and Sep 2021 saw a rise in pct change which is only surpassed by the pct change during the year 2010. 3. Also, what I thought was Goldman Sachs will be having major rise in pct change, but it seems that it is surpassed by Morgan Stanley during the year 2021.\n4. Bank of America had consistent pct change after July 2010 while for other banks it was not consistent or as I had taken only top 500 pct change the change was too low to come into the table.\n\n\nThank you guys for going through the notebook and I would appreciate any inputs or feedback on my EDA. Also, this my first time posting such analysis so apologies if I had not followed any proper eitquettes regarding my report.\n","metadata":{}}]}
